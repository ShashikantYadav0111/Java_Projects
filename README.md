# ☕ Java Projects – Showcasing Core Java Skills

Welcome to my Java project showcase! This repository is a collection of small, hands-on projects that demonstrate my understanding of core Java concepts. Each folder contains a focused example—ranging from networking and multithreading to file handling and algorithmic problem-solving.

---

## 📌 What This Repo Demonstrates

- 🔌 **Socket Programming** – Build low-level client-server apps
- 🧵 **Multithreading** – Use of `Thread`, `Runnable`, and synchronization
- 📂 **File I/O & NIO** – Reading/writing files using `Files`, `BufferedReader`, etc.
- 🧠 **DSA (Data Structures & Algorithms)** – Java-based solutions to common problems
- ⚙️ **Stream API** – Functional-style operations on collections
- 🌱 **Spring Boot** – Production-ready Java framework for microservice architecture.
